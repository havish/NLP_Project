edit_distance.py : Is used to form the class labels for predicting the lemma of a token.
extract_features.py : Extracts the considered features for every token in the training data.
predict_gender.py : Predicts the gender for every token in the test data and also measures the accuracy of the results.
predict_number.py : Predicts the number for every token in the test data and also measures the accuracy of the results.
predict_person.py : Predicts the person morph tag for every token in the test data and also measures the accuracy of the results.
predict_case.py : Predicts the case morph tag for every token in the test data and also measures the accuracy of the results.

First run the extract features.py to extract all the features from the training data , then run the appropriate predict_morphtag.py code to get the resutls.
